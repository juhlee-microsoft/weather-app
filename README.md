weather app
This is the simple weather app on your web browser. This pulls out the Clark county, US weather information from http://openweathermap.org API, 
and displays the output. 

I hope this motivates all young engineers who could get involve the Python programming. 

Simply pull out the code in git repository, and run in your Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio Code (Free), https://code.visualstudio.com/
You could. You should need to open the account in http://openweathermap.org (free), and use the existing API key or create your own. 
Once new API key is available, replace it in the URL path in the views.py file.

This program is free for all educative purposes.
Enjoy the Python programming.
